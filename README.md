This homework repo contains a modification of the powers package. The folder is here:

- [Alvin's powers package](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-alvin-q/tree/master/powers)

I've made a family of new logarithm functions. This screenshot shows these new functions.

Here is the help document for this family of log functions.

We can see that these functions pass our new set of tests.

Also, we can check the package. There are no errors.
